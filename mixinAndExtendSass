@mixin no-variable {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #FFF;
  opacity: .9;
}

%placeholder {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #FFF;
  opacity: .9;
}

span {
  @extend %placeholder;
}

div {
  @extend %placeholder;
}

p {
  @include no-variable;
}

h1 {
  @include no-variable;
}
would compile to:

span, div{
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #FFF;
  opacity: .9;
}

p {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #FFF;
  opacity: .9;
  //rules specific to ps
}

h1 {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #FFF;
  opacity: .9;
  //rules specific to ps
}
We can clearly see extending results in way cleaner and more efficient output with as little repetition as possible.

As a general rule of thumb, you should

Try to only create mixins that take in an argument, otherwise you should extend.
Always look at your CSS output to make sure your extend is behaving as you intended.
